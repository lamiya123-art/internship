# 🌍 Carbon Emissions Prediction — Climate Change Data Preprocessing

This repository contains a Python-based data cleaning and preprocessing pipeline developed as part of **Internship Assignment 1**. The project focuses on preparing a global climate dataset for further analysis and modeling related to **CO₂ emissions** and **climate change trends**.

---

## 📌 Key Features

✅ Cleans and preprocesses raw global climate indicator data  
✅ Removes irrelevant columns and filters out non-numeric entries  
✅ Handles missing values (both row-wise and column-wise)  
✅ Renames complex feature names to concise, readable formats  
✅ Transforms the dataset into a tidy, analysis-ready structure  
✅ Exports the cleaned data to a `.csv` file for modeling and visualization  

---

## 🧠 Objective

To prepare a robust, structured dataset that supports **exploratory data analysis** and helps uncover relationships between **urban growth**, **energy use**, and **carbon output**.

---

## 📂 Output

- `data_cleaned.csv` — Final, cleaned dataset for analysis  

---

## 📊 Data Exploration Highlights

- Analyzed correlation between **CO₂ emissions per capita** and **urban population growth**  
- Visualized energy consumption (`en_per_cap`) and its impact on emissions  
- Explored urban agglomeration effects using **bubble plots**  
- Identified multicollinearity using **VIF (Variance Inflation Factor)** for feature selection  

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- Seaborn, Matplotlib (for visualization)
